Snowflake provides a plugin-based backend and a set of APIs powering an modern HTML5 frontend for Emulators with unprecendented integration and easy of use, without needing to modify or recompile the base emulator; allowing for maximum compatibility.


Documentation
-------------
Preliminary documentation is available [here](http://snowflakepowe.red/doc/html/). As we document out API, we'll also be writing quick start guides on creating plugins.

Contributing
------------
Feel free to extend the API or document existing ones by forking Snowflake. Javascript (Ajax) API contributions are also welcome at this point. 

What's Possible?
----------------
Anything that's possible to do in HTML5 will be possible on Snowflake. Including Material Design (coming soon)

I don't code, what can I do with Snowflake?
-------------------------------------------
Nothing yet, hang on while we get our API stable and start to write the UI!
