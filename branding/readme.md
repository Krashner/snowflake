The Ring Logo
----------------
![Logo][ring]

The ring logo is the type-less version of the Snowflake logo. A white rounded snowflake is contained within a yellow circle. A blue directional pad with white accents peeks out horizontally from half the snowflake, the other half remains unseen, disappearing between the snowflake's bottom dendrites. The snowflake and directional pad arrows are oddly lit, with outer shadows forming at a shallow acute degree on some sub-dendrites of the snowflake. 

Going clockwise from the dendrite pointing directly up, here are the locations of the shadows:

* On the middle sub-dendrite on the first dendrite going leftwards
* On the middle and right sub-dendrite on the second dendrite going going leftwards
* On the middle sub-dendrite on the third dendrite going rightwards
* On the right sub-dendrite on the fourth dendrite going leftwards
* On the middle sub-dendrite on the fifth dendrite going leftwards

The directional pad arrows are as follows

* The arrow pointing left casts an outer shadow on the directional-pad interior on the bottom edge of the arrow
* The arrow pointing up lasts an inner shadow on itself on the right edge of the arrow
  
The colours used are as follows:

* #ABD5FF Blue Outer Ring
* #D48AFF Purple Outer Ring
* #FFEB97 Yellow Ring Interior
* #FFFFFF White Snowflake and Directional Pad Arrows
* #4ABAFF Blue Directional Pad Interrior

Shadows are formed by adding 22% black to the colour onto which the shadow has been cast.

The banner logo
------------------
![Logo][banner]

The banner logo has 'SNOWFLAKE' written in all capitals as well as some other typographical features as well as the Ring logo set on the left side. There is approximately 45px space between the Type and the Ring logo. The height of the banner logo should equal the height of the Ring, and the main 'Snowflake' should be vertically centered on the image.

40px beneath "SNOWFLAKE" is a horizontal rule and a subtitle. The subtitle text contains the word 'Snowflake' written in Katakana スノーフレーク (*sunōfurēku*), a bullet mark, and the words "emulator frontend" in lowercase letters — *"スノーフレーク • emulator frontend"*. These elements are aligned with the "S" in "SNOWFLAKE". The horizontal rule has the same length as the length of the "SNOWFLAKE" and should end where the "E" ends.
  
The colours for the text is as follows

* #000000 Black "SNOWFLAKE"
* #8C8C8C Grey Subtitle Elements and Horizontal Rule

The sizes of the elements relative to an image height of 2048px are as follows:

* 12pt Horizontal Rule Thickness
* 1296pt "SNOWFLAKE"
* 128pt "スノーフレーク • emulator frontend"

The fonts used are as follows. Some fonts may not be free, feel free to substitute a similar font if needed, however, please ensure that the font retains the same serifness.

* Bebas Neue Light "SNOWFLAKE"
* Kozuka Gothic (小塚ゴシック) Pr6N Regular "スノーフレーク"
* Caslon Regular "• emulator frontend"

###Why is there katakana in the logo  
There is no actual reason why there is katakana in the logo besides the fact that I think it looks cool. Feel free to create a banner that omits the katakana and the bullet mark, aligning "emulator frontend" with the horizontal rule.
